## Exercise 2.13

> What is the value of j in the following program?
```c++
int i = 42;
int main()
{
  int i = 100;
  int j = i;
}
```
> 100/Cause the global i was hidden bu the local i

## Exercise 2.14

> Is the following program legal?If so,what values are printed?
```c++
int i = 100, sum = 0;
for(int i = 0;i != 10; ++i)
    sum += i;
std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;
```
> It is legal/Printed:100 45

## Exercise 2.15

> Which of the following definitions, if any,are invalid?
- int ival = 1.01 / valid
- int &rval1 = 1.01 / invalid.initializer must be an object
- int &rval2 = ival; /valid.
- int &rval3; / invalid.a reference must be initialized

## Exercise 2.16

> Which.if any.of the following assignments are invalid?If they are valid. explain what they do.
```c++
int i = 0,&r1 = i;
double d = 0,&r2 = d;
```
- r2 = 3.14159; /valid
- r2 = r1; / valid.automatic convert will happen.
- i = r2; / valid.but value will bu truncated
- r1 = d; / valid.but value will be truncated

## Exercise 2.17

> What does the following code print?
```cpp
int i =, &ri = i;
i = 5;ri = 10;
std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl;
```
- 10,10
d
d

## Exercise 2.18

> Write code to change the value of a pointer.Write code to change the value to Which the pointer points
```cpp
int a = 0,b = 1;
int &p1 = &a,*p2 = p1;
// change the value of a pointer
p1 = &b;
// change the value to which the pointer points
*p2 = b;
```

## Exercise 2.20

> What does the following program do ?
```cpp
int i = 42;
int *p1 = &i;
*p1 = *p1 * *p1;
```
- p1 pointer to i , i's value changed to 42*42

## Exercise 2.21

> Explain each of the following definitions / Indicate whether any are illegal and,if so ,why.
```cpp
int i = 0;
double *dp = &i; // illegal/cannot initialize a variable of type double* with an rvalue of type int*
int *ip = i; // illegal
int *p = &i; //legal
```


## Exercise 2.22
```cpp
if(p) // whether p is nullptr?
if(*p) // whether the value pointed bu p is zero?
```

## const限定符

> 初始化
```cpp
int i = 42;
const int ci = i; // legal
int j = ci; // legal
```

## Exercise 2.26

> Which of the following are legal?For those that are illegal/explain why.
```cpp
const int buf; // illegal/buf is uninitialized const
int cnt = 0; //legal
const int sz = cnt; // legal
++cnt; // legal
++sz; // illegal,attempt to write to const object(sz).
```

## const的引用
```cpp
int i = 42;
int &r1 = i;
const int &r2 = i;
r1 = 0;
r2 = 0; //错误/r2是一个常量引用/但是可以通过r1一样绑定到i的引用来修改
```

## Exercise 2.27

> Which of the following initializations are legal?
```cpp

```
