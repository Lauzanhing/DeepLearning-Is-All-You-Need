## Exercise 2.13

> What is the value of j in the following program?
```c++
int i = 42;
int main()
{
  int i = 100;
  int j = i;
}
```
> 100/Cause the global i was hidden bu the local i

## Exercise 2.14

> Is the following program legal?If so,what values are printed?
```c++
int i = 100, sum = 0;
for(int i = 0;i != 10; ++i)
    sum += i;
std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;
```
> It is legal/Printed:100 45

## Exercise 2.15

> Which of the following definitions, if any,are invalid?
- int ival = 1.01 / valid
- int &rval1 = 1.01 / invalid.initializer must be an object
- int &rval2 = ival; /valid.
- int &rval3; / invalid.a reference must be initialized

## Exercise 2.16

> Which.if any.of the following assignments are invalid?If they are valid. explain what they do.
```c++
int i = 0,&r1 = i;
double d = 0,&r2 = d;
```
- r2 = 3.14159; /valid
- r2 = r1; / valid.automatic convert will happen.
- i = r2; / valid.but value will bu truncated
- r1 = d; / valid.but value will be truncated

## Exercise 2.17

> What does the following code print?
```cpp
int i =, &ri = i;
i = 5;ri = 10;
std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl;
```
